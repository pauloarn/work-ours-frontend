## Application Operation

FrontEnd project in ReactJs to control the entry and exit of employees, using an API developed in NODE, by the owner of this repository.

The application aims to control the moments of Entry, Lunch Break, Return of Lunch and departure at the end of the working day.

The application contains the registration of new employees, where they must be informed, their name, their password for access, and the number of hours they must work per day.

After registration, the User Id is informed, which must be used for the user to log in, together with the password entered in their registration.

After logging in, the user is redirected to his page, where his daily point registration will be made, and where his past records will be shown.

The data is loaded from your authentication token, which is saved after the user logs in, so the logged-in user can only add records to his Profile.
